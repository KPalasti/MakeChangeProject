# Make Change Project

## Description
This project will dispense change for a sale to a customer or notify them if they have given exact change or an insufficient amount. No 50 or 100 dollar bills will be accepted or given on behalf of the transaction.

## What I learned
This project helped me solidify my knowledge of int casting and modulus to move from each action to another. I had most difficulty with an unexpected rounding issue but Ashley was able to help me in tutoring and solve it. I also reviewed pulling and pushing to GitHub and am becoming more orientated with the website features and access.

### Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse, Git, Atom
